<h3 id="section3-1">3.1 Collection and cleaning of the data</h3>
<p>
  Secondary and primary data were gathered from local authorities (LAs) at pupil
  level, with a record for each applicant for a school place.
</p>
<p>
  This data has been aggregated by DfE into the local authority level figures
  provided in this release.
</p>
<p>
  The data collected is the position as at the respective national offer day. It
  includes all offers made on that day, regardless of whether they were
  subsequently accepted or refused.
</p>
<p>
  Cleaning of the data prior to aggregation may cause slight differences between
  the figures contained in this publication and any released by the LAs
  themselves closer to the respective national offer days.
</p>
<p>
  In some cases an application was recorded by both the home authority (to whom
  the application was made) and also by the LA within which the school where a
  place was offered is based.
</p>
<p>
  To be correct, only the home authority to whom the applicant sent their form
  should record the application and offer. Therefore the duplicate record
  submitted by the LA in which the school is based has been removed.
</p>
<p>
  Applications listing preferences or offers to schools which could not be
  identified from the school census,
  <!-- -->
  <a href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/"
    >Get Information About Schools</a
  >
  <!-- -->or via one of the additional 'dummy' school codes used to identify new
  schools or split entries (see below) were removed.
</p>
<p>
  Other very small adjustments have been made as required to the source data to
  ensure that we provide as full and accurate a picture of the application and
  offer process as possible (for example, removing the second example if two
  offers have been recorded for one applicant, causing double-counting).
</p>
<h3 id="section3-2">3.2 Interpretation of the figures</h3>
<p>
  The figures are based on the offers sent out by LAs on the respective national
  offer days.
</p>
<p>
  The final numbers of pupils starting in specific schools is likely to be
  different due to late applicants, refusal of offers, subsequent offers made
  via a second offer round or via the schools' waiting lists, or successful
  appeals. Revised figures incorporating any subsequent changes are not
  collected or published.
</p>
<p>
  The inclusion of a school by an applicant as one of their preferences does not
  mean that they meet the admissions criteria for that school.
</p>
<p>
  Examples of where the applicant has little or no chance of being admitted on
  national offer day include naming a selective school having not passed the
  grammar entrance test, living a long way out of catchment for a popular
  community school and requesting a place for a boy at a girls' school.
</p>
<p>
  Some schools offer places via a lottery, where everyone who applies has an
  equal (subject to fair banding) chance of being considered, which may
  encourage applications.
</p>
<p>
  If an authority is not able to make an offer of a preferred school, in most
  cases they offer a place at an alternative school.
</p>
<p>
  However, some authorities chose instead to send the applicant a list of
  schools with available places and invite them to state which of these schools
  they would prefer their child to attend. These incidences are recorded as the
  applicant receiving no offer.
</p>
<p>
  A total of five LAs made no alternative offers on secondary national offer
  day, to applicants to whom they were not able to make an offer of one of their
  preferred schools, and six made no alternative offers on primary national
  offer day.
</p>
<p>
  The tables include the percentage of offers which are of schools a) within or
  b) outside the LA to which the application was made. These are calculated as a
  proportion of all offers, including those made to non-applicants (see table
  notes).
</p>
<p>
  The LAs were asked not to provide data on school places offered to children
  with an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHC) or statement of special
  educational needs (SEN), since the parents of these children were not required
  to apply for a school place.
</p>
<p>
  However, there are a number of applications where special schools were amongst
  the preferences stated and, in some cases, a special school has been offered.
</p>
<p>
  It's assumed these are offers to SEN children who do not have a statement or
  EHCP. These preferences and offers have been included in the final figures.
</p>
<p>
  At secondary level the application is for the main entry point into secondary
  school in that local authority. This is usually year 7 but a small number of
  authorities have a main entry point in year 9 and this is what they report on.
</p>
<p>
  For LAs with more than one entry point, the intake with the largest number of
  places available is the one reported.
</p>
<p>
  Places at schools such as UTCs and studio schools, whose intake is in year 10
  (at age 14 years) are not allocated via the co-ordinated admissions process
  and therefore are not included in these figures.
</p>
<p>
  Some schools have two entry routes. At primary school this is generally a
  school with a single school code but with two sites, each of which can be
  applied for separately.
</p>
<p>
  At secondary level the two routes are usually either a school with day and
  boarding places, or a school with a number of places reserved for those
  passing aptitude tests (for example, in music or languages).
</p>
<p>
  In these cases, parents can apply for both routes (e.g. for both sites of a
  split-site primary school), so a 'dummy' school code is used to identify the
  second option for each affected school.
</p>
<p>
  All mainstream state-funded schools, including academies, are included in the
  figures.
</p>
<p>
  However, new opener free schools can have a rapid set-up process and may not
  be ready in time to make their offers within the local authority co-ordinated
  exercise.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, for their first year of operation only, free schools may make
  offers directly and those that do so will be excluded from these figures. In
  their second year of operation, they must make offers within the local
  authority co-ordination process.
</p>
<p>
  The Isles of Scilly local authority has one school which takes pupils between
  the ages of 3 and 16.
</p>
<p>
  Parents are not required to complete an application form and there is no
  competition for a place at the school. Therefore this authority has been
  omitted from both tables as preference rates cannot be calculated.

</p>
<p>
  However, information on primary level preferences is only included from 2014
  onwards.
</p>
<p>
  This is when DfE started collecting data on primary applications and offers,
  based on the newly introduced national primary offer day of 16 April (or next
  working day).
