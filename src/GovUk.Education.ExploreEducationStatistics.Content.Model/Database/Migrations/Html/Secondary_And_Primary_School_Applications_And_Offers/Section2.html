<h3 id="section2-1">2.1 The admissions process</h3>
<p>
  Each local authority (LA) runs the coordinated admissions process for all
  state-funded schools in its area.
</p>
<p>
  It receives applications for all children resident in its area, including for
  those who wish to apply to schools in another local authority.
</p>
<p>
  The authorities liaise with each other to ensure that all applications for
  schools outside the home LA are received by, and included in, the coordination
  exercise of the LA in which the school is based.
</p>
<p>
  However, the applications are in all cases reported within these tables under
  the LA to whom the application is made - that is, the one in which the child
  is resident.
</p>
<p>
  Parents submit their application on a single form returned to their home
  authority, listing their preferred schools in order of preference.
</p>
<p>
  LAs must allow parents to express at least three preferences at each level
  (primary and secondary).
</p>
<p>
  In practice, different LAs allow parents to express between three and six
  preferences.
</p>
<p>
  The number of preferences allowed by an authority can vary at primary and at
  secondary level.
</p>
<p>
  Applications for each school are ranked against the school's published
  priority and oversubscription criteria.
</p>
<a
  >Where a child could be offered a place at more than one of their preferred
  schools, they are offered the school listed as the highest preference.</a
>
<p>
  Authorities must publish information on the admissions criteria of all the
  schools in their area, including data on volume of applications for the
  available places in previous years - that is, whether they received more or
  fewer applications than they had places available in those years.
</p>
<p>
  LAs send parents a single offer of a school place on national offer day, which
  is the 1 March (or next working day) for secondary offers and 16 April (or
  next working day) for primary offers.
</p>
<p>
  Parents are entitled to appeal to the relevant admission authority against a
  refusal to offer a place. These appeals are not reported in this publication.
</p>
<p>
  Figures for appeals lodged, heard and the appeal result relating to entry into
  the start of the 2017/18 academic year will be published in August on DfE's
  website.
