<dl class="govuk-list">
  <dt>Permanent or fixed-period exclusion rate</dt>
  <dd>
    (Number of permanent exclusions recorded across the whole academic year /
    Number of sole and dual main registered pupils on roll as at January census
    dat) X 100
  </dd>
  <dt>Pupils with one or more fixed-period exclusion rate</dt>
  <dd>
    (Number of pupils with one of more fixed-period exclusions in full academic
    year / Number of sole and dual main registered pupils on roll as at January
    census day) X 100
  </dd>
  <dt>Proportion of all exclusions</dt>
  <dd>(Number of exclusions / Overall total number of exclusions) X 100</dd>
  <dt>Average exclusions per day</dt>
  <dd>Number of exclusions / 190</dd>
  <dt>Average fixed-period exclusions per pupil</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of fixed-period exclusions / Number of pupils with one or more
    fixed-period exclusions
  </dd>
  <dt>Average length of fixed-period exclusions</dt>
  <dd>
    Total number of fixed-period exclusion sessions / Total number of
    fixed-period exclusions
