<h3 id="section1-1">1.1 Requirements for schools</h3>
<p>
  The headteacher of a school can exclude a pupil on disciplinary grounds only.
</p>
<p>
  Good discipline in schools is essential to ensure all pupils can benefit from
  the opportunities provided by education.
</p>
<p>
  The decision to exclude a pupil must be lawful, reasonable and fair. In
  addition, schools have a statutory duty not to discriminate against pupils on
  the basis of protected characteristics, such as disability or race.
</p>
<p>
  Schools and LAs must arrange alternative provision from the sixth day of the
  exclusion of pupils of compulsory school age.

<h3 id="section1-2">1.2 Uses and users of exclusion statistics and data</h3>
<p>
  The data used to publish exclusions statistics is collected via the school
  census which is used by a variety of companies and organisations including:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>mainstream and specialist media companies</li>
  <li>housing websites such as Rightmove and Zoopla</li>
  <li>specialist publications such as the good schools guide</li>
  <li>data analysis organisations such the Fischer Family Trust</li>
  <li>
    academic research and think tank organisations such as Durham University and
    the Education Policy Institute
  </li>
  <li>
    central government organisations such as DfE, Ofsted and other government
    departments
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The published data is also used in answers to parliamentary questions and
  public enquiries - including those made under the Freedom of Information Act.
</p>
<h3 id="section1-3">1.3 Current publications</h3>
<p>
  DfE publishes annual exclusions data via the Permanent and fixed-period
  exclusions in England National Statistics release in July each year.
</p>
<p>
  Links to all exclusions publications can be found in<!-- -->
  <a href="#annex-sections-heading-3">Annex C</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="section1-4">1.4 Key exclusion measures</h3>
<p>
  DfE monitors pupil exclusion levels using key measures based on two types of
  exclusion - permanent and fixed-period.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Permanent exclusion</strong> refers to a pupil who's excluded and who
  will not come back to that school (unless the exclusion is overturned).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Fixed-period exclusion</strong> refers to a pupil who's excluded from
  a school for a set period of time.
</p>
<p>
  A fixed-period exclusion can involve a part of the school day and does not
  have to be for a continuous period.
</p>
<p>
  A pupil may be excluded for one or more fixed-periods up to a maximum of 45
  school days in a single academic year.
</p>
<p>
  This total includes exclusions from previous schools covered by the exclusion
  legislation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Pupils with one or more fixed period exclusions</strong> refers to
  pupils who have at least one fixed-period exclusion across the full academic
  year.
</p>
<p>It includes those with repeated fixed-period exclusions.</p>
<p>
  For further information:<!-- -->
  <a href="#section3-1">3.1 Calculation of exclusion rates</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="section1-5">1.5 Cohort used in exclusion measures</h3>
<p>
  Exclusions information relates to all exclusions reported across the full
  academic year.
</p>
<p>
  However, exclusion rates are calculated as a proportion of all pupils on roll
  as at the January Census day of the relevant academic year.
</p>
<h3 id="section1-6">1.6 Lunch time exclusions</h3>
<p>
  DfE also collects lunch time exclusions via the school census. This is where a
  pupil whose behaviour at lunchtime has been disruptive such that they are
  excluded from the school premises for the duration of the lunchtime period.
</p>
<p>
  However, these figures are not reported in published exclusions statistics and
  they're not included in fixed-period exclusion totals.
</p>
<h3 id="section1-7">
  1.7 Published geographical and characteristics breakdowns
</h3>
<p>
  DfE routinely publishes pupil exclusions information at national and local
  authority level including breakdowns by pupil characteristics.
</p>
<p>
  School level data is also released but it should be noted that DfE does not
  hold individual schools to account based purely on their exclusion figures and
  does not set exclusion thresholds or targets on the use of exclusion.
</p>
<p>
  Ofsted assesses schools' use of exclusion as part of inspection arrangements.
</p>
<p>
  A list of all routinely published breakdowns is available in<!-- -->

</p>
<h3 id="section1-8">1.8 Appeals and reviews relating to permanent exclusion</h3>
<p>
  In addition to permanent and fixed-period exclusions figures, releases also
  include information on the number of appeals and reviews relating to permanent
  exclusions reported by local authorities (LAs).

<p>
  From the 2009/09 academic year, each release has been accompanied by
  underlying data, including national, local authority and school level
  information.

  Alongside the underlying data there's an accompanying document (metadata)
  which provides further information on the contents of these files.
