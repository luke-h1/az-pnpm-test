<p>
  The following sections outline how exclusions data goes from raw school census
  returns to a finalised dataset used to prepare National Statistics releases.
</p>
<h3 id="section5-1">5.1 Data linking</h3>
<p>
  Exclusions data is collected at exclusion level and therefore aggregated to
  annual figures by simply summing the number of termly exclusions together.
</p>
<p>Each exclusion is reported alongside a unique pupil identifier.</p>
<p>
  Pupil level exclusions data is derived by linking exclusion records collected
  in each termly census to unique pupil identifiers, giving the total number of
  exclusions received by each pupil across a given period (such as term or
  academic year).
</p>
<p>
  Exclusions are then linked to the relevant pupil's characteristics data (also
  collected via the school census) at the term of the exclusion.
</p>
<p>
  Where characteristics data is missing, information collected in the census
  term reporting the exclusion is used.
</p>
<p>
  If, again, data is also missing here a range of other relevant censuses will
  be used to attempt to find a characteristic (except for ethnicity as this
  information is only collected in the spring school census) as per Table 4:
  Characteristics linking for exclusion data.

<h3 id="section5-2">5.2 Data removed</h3>
<p>
  To prepare the exclusions data for publication routine checks are applied to
  the linked data and where necessary data is removed as follows.
</p>
<p>
  Lunch time exclusions are not reported in published exclusions statistics.
</p>
<p>
  Any exclusions from sponsored academies with a start date before the academy
  opened are removed before analysis.
</p>
<p>
  They're removed because when a sponsored academy opens it's a new school and
  not responsible for exclusions accrued within the predecessor school.
</p>
<p>
  Year-on-year comparisons of local authority (LA) data may be affected by
  schools converting to academies.
</p>
<h3 id="section5-3">5.3 Variables added</h3>
<p>
  Most of the variables needed to produce national level exclusions statistics
  can be calculated directly from the fields collected via the school census.
</p>
<p>
  However, to prepare the data for publication the following variables are also
  added to the dataset.
</p>
<h4 id="section5-3-1">5.3.1 Pupils with one or more fixed period exclusion</h4>
<p>
  Pupils with one or more fixed period exclusion across the academic year are
  identified as such and are then used in the one or more fixed-period exclusion
  measure.
</p>
<h4 id="section5-3-2">5.3.2 School and academy type</h4>
<p>
  School type information - including school type, academy type and academy open
  date - is added to our underlying data prior to producing any analysis to
  allow us to produce the school- and academy-type breakdowns in our statistical
  releases.
</p>
<p>
  These variables are derived using a combination of Edubase and the academies
  and academy projects in development data.
</p>
<p>
  Within exclusion National Statistics, academies are only indicated as
  academies if they were open as of 12 September.
