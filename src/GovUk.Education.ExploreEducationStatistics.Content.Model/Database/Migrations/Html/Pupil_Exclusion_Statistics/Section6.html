<h3 id="section6-1">Data quality</h3>
<p>
  The following should be taken into account when reviewing published exclusions
  statistics.
</p>
<p>
  The exclusions information reported in published releases is based on data
  returned by schools as part of the school census.
</p>
<p>
  It does not include data which has been submitted by local authorities (LAs)
  or schools outside of the school census.<!-- -->
</p>
<p>
  It's a school's responsibility to record exclusions data correctly in their
  school census return.
</p>
<p>
  As exclusions information is collected two terms in arrears, when a school
  closes and is replaced by a sponsored academy data is not available for the
  last two terms that the predecessor school was open.
</p>
<p>
  Caution is recommended when interpreting the data for Traveller of Irish
  Heritage and Gypsy/Roma children due to small population sizes.
</p>
<h4 id="section6-1-1">6.1.1 Data checking</h4>
<p>
  Prior to the release of exclusion National Statistics the raw data goes
  through a thorough quality assurance process to ensure it is fit for purpose.
</p>
<p>The main areas of this checking are:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>matching derived data back to raw sources</li>
  <li>
    comparing year-on-year trends across different geographies and pupil groups
    to look for and investigate substantial changes
  </li>
  <li>comparing figures and trends to other published sources</li>
  <li>
    cross-checking data within the release to ensure totals are consistent
  </li>
</ul>
