<h3 id="section3-1">3.1 Calculation of exclusion rates</h3>
<p>
  Within published exclusions statistics both the number of exclusions and the
  rate of exclusion are presented.
</p>
<p>
  Rates of exclusion are a more appropriate measure for comparisons over time as
  they take into account changes in the overall number of pupils across
  different academic years.
</p>
<p>
  As pupils can receive more than one fixed-period exclusion, in some cases the
  rate of exclusion may be above 100%.
</p>
<p>
  The following sections outline the methodology used to calculate exclusion
  rates - including a change implemented as of the 2013/14 academic year.
</p>
<h4 id="section3-1-1">3.1.1 2013/14 releases onwards</h4>
<p>
  This change is an improvement as it more accurately reflects the number of
  pupils who could be excluded, resulting in more accurate exclusion rates.
</p>
<p>
  This change has a minor effect on exclusion rates, but to assist users
  recalculated time series data have been made available within national
  published time series tables and underlying data.
</p>
<p>Figures on numbers of exclusions are not affected by this change.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-s">
  Permanent exclusion rate = (Number of permanent exclusions recorded across
  whole academic year / Number of sole and dual main registered pupils on roll
  as of January census day) X 100
</p>
<p class="govuk-body-s">
  Fixed-period exclusion rate = (Number of fixed-period exclusions recorded
  across whole academic year / Number of sole and dual main registered pupils on
  roll as of January census day) X 100
</p>
<h4 id="section3-1-1">3.1.2 2013/14 releases onwards</h4>
<p>
  Prior to the 2013/14 annual exclusions release, exclusion rates were
  calculated as a percentage of the total number of solely registered pupils on
  roll as at January census day.
</p>
<p>Formulae for exclusion rates prior to the 2013/14 release are as follows:</p>
<p class="govuk-body-s">
  Permanent exclusion rate = (Number of permanent exclusions recorded across
  whole academic year / Number of sole registered pupils on roll as of January
  census day) X 100
</p>
<p class="govuk-body-s">
  Fixed-period exclusion rate = (Number of fixed-period exclusions recorded
  across whole academic year / Number of sole registered pupils on roll as of
  January census day) X 100
</p>
<h3 id="section3-2">
  3.2 Permanent exclusion checking exercise 1997/98 to 2009/10
</h3>
<p>
  Due to some known under-reporting and some over-reporting of permanent
  exclusions, a data checking exercise with local authorities was carried out
  from 1997/98 to 2009/10 to confirm the number of permanent exclusions.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, for these years, permanent exclusion figures are estimates based on
  incomplete pupil level data.
</p>
<p>
  The checking exercise took place at local authority level, where the number of
  permanent exclusions reported by schools via the schools census were compared
  to the number of permanent exclusions confirmed by each local authority.
</p>
<p>
  This resulted in a pro-rate variable for each reported exclusion, where each
  exclusion could account for more or less depending on if schools within the
  local authority were deemed to have over or under reported their exclusions.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body-s">
  Permanent pro rate = Number of permanent exclusions confirmed by local
  authority during checking exercise for each school / Number of permanent
  exclusions reported in school census for each type of school
</p>
<p>
  For example, if 5 permanent exclusions were reported for primary schools by a
  local authority via the school census but 10 permanent exclusions for primary
  schools were confirmed by the local authority during the checking exercise,
  each individual reported permanent exclusion was subsequently counted as 2.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body-s">
  Published permanent exclusion figure = (Number of permanent exclusions
  reported in school census X Permanent pro rate
</p>
<p>
  This issue has decreased over time and the checking exercise was discontinued
  following the 2009/10 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  Following this - ie from the 2010/11 publication onwards - published permanent
  exclusion figures are as reported by schools.
</p>

  3.3 Appeals and reviews relating to permanent exclusions
</h3>
<p>
  Parents (and pupils if aged over 18 years) are able to request a review of a
  permanent exclusion.
</p>
<p>
  Data on independent review panels regarding permanent exclusions is collected
  at local authority level via an annual survey. Data was first collected for
  the 2012/13 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  Information on the old independent appeal panels has been collected by DfE via
  an annual survey since 1994/95.
</p>
<p>
  However, figures for 1994/95 to 1996/97 are known to be incomplete. Therefore,
  in the majority of releases, appeals data has been published from 1997/98
  onwards.

<h4 id="section3-3-1">
  3.3.1 Reviews of permanent exclusions: 2012/13 onwards
</h4>
<p>
  From 1 September 2012, independent appeal panels were replaced with
  independent review panels - a new system by which the governing body's
  decision to uphold a permanent exclusion decision can be reviewed.
</p>
<p>
  The role of the independent review panel is to review the governing body's
  decision not to reinstate a permanently excluded pupil.
</p>
<p>
  In reviewing the decision the panel must consider the interests and
  circumstances of the excluded pupil, including the circumstances in which the
  pupil was excluded, and have regard to the interests of other pupils and
  people working at the school.
</p>
<p>
  Where a panel decides that a governing body's decision is flawed in the light
  of the principles applicable on an application for judicial review, it can
  direct the governing body to reconsider its decision.
</p>
<p>
  If the governing body does not subsequently offer to reinstate a pupil, the
  panel will be expected to order that the school makes an additional payment of
  Â£4,000.
</p>
<p>
  This payment will go to the local authority. In other circumstances a panel
  can recommend, rather than direct, that a governing body reconsiders its
  decision.
</p>
<p>
  No additional payment is required if reinstatement is not offered following a
  recommendation to reconsider.
</p>
<p>
  Whether or not a school recognises that a pupil has special educational needs
  (SEN), all parents (or pupils if aged 18 or over) have the right to request
  the presence of a SEN expert at an independent review panel.
</p>
<p>
  The SEN expert's role is to provide impartial advice to the panel about how
  SEN could be relevant to the exclusion.
</p>
<p>
  For example, whether the school acted reasonably in relation to its SEN duties
  when excluding the pupil.
</p>
<p>
  The data does not show whether any reinstatement offer has been accepted by
  parents.
</p>
<h4 id="section3-3-1">
  3.3.2 Appeals against permanent exclusions: prior to 2012/13
</h4>
<p>
  Prior to 1 September 2012, independent appeal panels were used to appeal the
  decision to permanently exclude a pupil. Panels could either:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>uphold the exclusion</li>
  <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
  <li>
    overturn the exclusion. In this case they could either:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        direct immediate reinstatement or reinstatement at some future date
      </li>
      <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
      <li>
        decide that because of exceptional circumstances or other reasons it was
        not practical to give a direction requiring reinstatement, but that it
        would otherwise have been appropriate to give such a direction
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
