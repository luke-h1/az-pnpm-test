<h3 id="section4-1">4.1 The collection process</h3>
<p>The school census collects exclusions information two terms in arrears.</p>
<p>
  For example, the summer school census collects information on exclusions
  occurring during the autumn term.
</p>
<p>
  Data is collected two terms in arrears to allow time for any independent
  reviews panels and governing body reconsiderations to be concluded before
  supplying information to DfE.

<h3 id="section4-2">4.2 Background of absence data collection</h3>
<p>
  The following sections outline how exclusions data collection has changed
  since it was first collected in 1994/95.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-2-1">4.2.1 School census: 2005/06 to present</h4>
<p>
  In <strong>summer 2006</strong> the school census started to collect
  exclusions data on a termly basis (spring, summer and autumn collections) from
  maintained secondary schools, 14 city technology colleges and academies to
  cover the 2005/06 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  The collection amalgamated the previous annual school census and termly
  exclusion survey, covering both permanent and fixed period exclusions as well
  as reason for exclusion – all collected at a pupil level.
</p>
<p>
  In published statistics there is a data gap for fixed period exclusions
  occurring within primary and special schools for the<!-- -->
  <strong>2005/06 academic year</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  This is because these schools did not move to the termly census collection
  until the following year, and the termly exclusion survey was discontinued in
  2004/05.
</p>
<p>
  Permanent exclusions in 2005/06 continued to be collected for primary and
  special schools via the annual school census.
</p>
<p>
  In the <strong>summer 2007</strong> school census the scope of the collection
  was extended to include primary and special schools, collecting exclusions
  data for the 2006/07 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  In the <strong>spring 2014</strong> school census the scope of the collection
  was extended again to include termly pupil referral unit (PRU) exclusion data.
</p>
<p>
  Previously this information had been collected annually via the PRU census
  which ran from 2010 to 2013.
</p>
<p>
  The first full academic year of PRU exclusions data was collected for the
  2013/14 academic year.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-2-2">4.2.2 Termly exclusions survey: 2002/03 to 2004/05</h4>
<p>
  The termly exclusions survey was first carried out in<!-- -->
  <strong>summer 2003</strong>, collecting fixed-period exclusions for the first
  time for the 2003 summer term.
</p>
<p>
  There was evidence of under reporting from schools and this term of data was
  published as experimental statistics.
</p>
<p>
  In <strong>2003/04</strong> the first full academic year of fixed period
  exclusions data was collected via the termly exclusion survey. The survey also
  collected termly permanent exclusions for the first time.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, reason for exclusion was collected via the termly exclusions
  survey for the first time as of the
  <!-- -->
  <strong>2003/04 academic year</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  In published statistics for <strong>2003/04 and 2004/05</strong> a combination
  of annual schools census and termly exclusion survey figures are published.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, permanent exclusion figures are sourced from the annual school
  census, with term and reason breakdowns coming from the termly exclusion
  survey.
</p>
<p>
  All fixed-period exclusion figures are sourced from the termly exclusion
  survey.
</p>
<p>
  The termly exclusions survey was discontinued after the collection of data for
  the <strong>2004/05 academic year</strong>.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-2-3">4.2.3 Annual school census: 1994/95 to 2001/02</h4>
<p>
  In <strong>1996</strong> permanent exclusions relating to the<!-- -->
  <strong>1994/95 academic year</strong> were first collected by DfE for
  primary, secondary and special schools via the annual school census. 1995/96
  is deemed to be the first reliable year of exclusions data.
</p>
<p>
  In <strong>2002</strong> the annual school census changed to an annual pupil
  level school census, collecting pupil level exclusions for the<!-- -->
  <strong>2000/01 academic year</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Permanent exclusions from City Technology Colleges (CTCs) and academies were
  also first collected for the 2000/01 academic year.
</p>
<h3 id="section4-3">4.3 Data coverage</h3>
<h4 id="section4-3-1">4.3.1 Coverage for 2006/07 to present</h4>
<p>
  Schools provide, via the school census, individual exclusion data for all
  pupils receiving a permanent or fixed-period exclusion within the collection
  period.
</p>
<p>
  Within published exclusions statistics, schools are categorised into the
  following phases.

<h4 id="section4-3-2">4.3.2 Coverage for 2005/06</h4>
<p>
  Exclusions information was collected on a termly basis, at enrolment level,
  via the school census for the first time to cover the 2005/06 academic year.
  In this first year of collection, information was collected for secondary
  schools only. For 2005/06 permanent exclusions for primary and special schools
  were collected via the annual school census.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-3-3">4.3.3 Coverage from 1994/95 to 2004/05</h4>
<p>
  Permanent exclusion information was collected via the annual school census, at
  school level, for all pupils in primary, secondary and special schools. From
  2000/01 the annual schools census moved to a pupil level collection and
  permanent exclusions from CTCs and academies were collected for the first
  time, though these were not included in published statistics until the 2006/07
  academic year.
</p>
<h3 id="section4-4">4.4 What exclusions information is collected</h3>
<p>
  Schools are expected to supply the following via their school census returns:
</p>
<h4 id="section4-4-1">4.4.1 Category of exclusion</h4>
<p>For each exclusion, this indicates the type of exclusion:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>fixed period</li>
  <li>lunch time - not included within published statistics</li>
  <li>permanent</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section4-4-2">4.4.2 Reason for exclusion</h4>
<p>
  For each exclusion, schools are required to report the main reason for
  exclusion.
</p>
<p>The following table provides descriptions of reasons for exclusions.</p>
<p>
  The categories should cover the main reasons for exclusions and the 'other'
  category should be used sparingly.
</p>
<p>
  The descriptions should be used as a guide and are not intended to be used as
  a tick list for exclusion decisions.

</table>
<h4 id="section4-4-3">4.4.3 Start date of exclusion</h4>
<p>
  Each exclusion is reported with a start date. This start date should reflect
  the date the exclusion starts - ie the date the pupil was asked to leave the
  school by the headteacher.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-4-4">4.4.4 Length of exclusion in sessions</h4>
<p>
  For each fixed-period and lunchtime exclusion, the actual number of sessions
  for which the exclusion is in effect is recorded.
</p>
<p>
  For fixed-period exclusions, each session counts as half a school day. For
  lunchtime exclusions, each lunchtime for which the exclusion applies counts as
  one session.
</p>
<p>
  Exclusion only covers the number of sessions the pupil is expected to be at
  the school.
</p>
<p>
  A fixed-period exclusion can be discontinuous which means there can be days
  between the start and finish dates of the exclusion that are not included as
  part of the exclusion.
</p>
<p>
  Where a pupil is dually registered, exclusion sessions are not recorded for
  the days when they would have been attending the other establishment.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a pupil is excluded for six sessions starting on a Monday.
  However, the pupil is registered with another provider on the Wednesday from
  which they have not been excluded.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Monday,
  Tuesday and Thursday. The pupil's attendance on the Wednesday would be
  recorded separately by the other provider.
</p>
<p>
  Exclusions sessions are not recorded for the days when the pupil is attending
  an approved educational activity.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a year 10 pupil has been excluded for six sessions starting on a
  Wednesday. However, the pupil attends work experience on a Thursday from which
  they're not excluded.
</p>
<p>
  The pupil in this situation would be excluded from the school for sessions on
  Wednesday, Friday and Monday.
</p>
<p>
  Days on which there's a planned school closure do not count towards an
  exclusion.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a pupil has been excluded from a school for four sessions
  starting on a Friday but the school is planned to be closed on the Monday for
  an INSET day.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore the pupil's exclusion should include the two sessions on the
  following Tuesday, rather than the Monday.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-4-5">4.4.5 In care and SEN indicators</h4>
<p>
  For each exclusion, the pupil's in care status and SEN provision at the time
  of exclusion is recorded. This may be different to their current provision.
</p>
<h3 id="section4-5">
  <!-- -->4.5 No longer collected but available historically
</h3>
<p>
  There is no exclusion data that has been collected historically that is no
  longer collected.
</p>
<h3 id="section4-6">4.6 What absence information is not collected</h3>
<p>DfE does not collect the following information:</p>
<h4 id="section4-6-1">
  4.6.1 Permanent exclusions overturned at governing body consideration stage
  and at governing body reconsideration stage
</h4>
<p>
  DfE does not collect information on permanent exclusions which were overturned
  at the governing body consideration stage and at governing body
  reconsideration stage.
</p>
<p>
  Those do not count as exclusions and the exclusion decision has effectively
  been overturned.
</p>
<p>
  By collecting the data two terms after that in which the exclusion started,
  it's anticipated that all the exclusion reviews and reconsiderations
  procedures would have been completed by the time the data is collected and so
  only exclusions which have been upheld will be included in school census
  returns.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-6-2">4.6.2 Specific details of exclusion incident</h4>
<p>
  Exclusions information is collected with a corresponding reason for exclusion.
</p>
<p>
  For further information on reasons collected:<!-- -->
  <a href="#section4-4-2">4.4.2 Reason for exclusion</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Specific details of the incident resulting in the exclusion are not collected
  via the school census.
</p>
<p>
  For example, the location of the incident, members involved in the incident,
  if weapons were used etc.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-6-3">4.6.3 Exclusions data for independent schools</h4>
<p>
  DfE does not collect exclusions data from independent and nursery schools.
</p>
