<h3 id="section3-1">3.1 Overall absence methodology</h3>
<p>
  An enrolment’s overall absence rate is the total number of overall absence
  sessions as a percentage of the total number of possible sessions available to
  that enrolment, where overall absence is the sum of authorised and
  unauthorised absence and one session is equal to half a day
</p>
<p>
  To calculate school, local authority and national level overall absence rates,
  the total absences and possible sessions for all enrolments within the
  relevant areas are included.

<p class="govuk-body-s">
  Overall absence rate = (Total overall absence sessions) / Total sessions
  possible) X 100

<h3 id="section3-2">3.2 Persistent absence methodology</h3>
<p>
  The persistent absence measure was introduced in 2005/06. The sections below
  outline how the measure has changed since it was implemented.
</p>
<p>
  In published releases, to allow users to compare over time, time series
  information is recalculated following any methodology change.

  3.2.2 2015/16 onwards (10% based on an exact methodology)
</h4>
<p>
  Since the start of the 2015/16 academic year schools, a pupil has been
  classified as a persistent absentee if they miss 10% or more of their own
  possible sessions, rather than if they reach a standard threshold of absence
  sessions.
</p>
<p>
  Meaning, that if an enrolment’s overall absence rate 10% or higher2 they'll be
  classified as persistently absent.

  3.2.3 2010/11 to 2014/15 methodology (15% PA threshold)
</h4>
<p>
  Pupils were identified as persistent absentees by comparing the number of
  overall absence sessions they had against a standard threshold of around 15%
  of possible sessions, equating to 56 or more sessions across the full academic
  year for pupils aged 5 to 14 and 46 or more sessions across the full academic
  year for pupils aged 15 (whose absence information is based on the first five
  half terms only, as any sixth half term absence is removed prior to analysis
  as set out in<!-- -->
  <a href="#section1-6"
    >1.6 The school year (five half terms vs six half terms)</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to 2012/13 (when absence data was first collected for the second half of
  the summer term), the threshold was 46 sessions across the first five half
  terms of the year for all pupils.
</p>
<p>
  For the autumn term, figures showed how many enrolments had already become
  persistent absentees, as well as those who may become persistent absentees
  based on the standard threshold of 22 or more sessions of absence.
</p>
<p>
  For the autumn and spring terms, figures showed how many enrolments had
  already become persistent absentees, as well as those who may become
  persistent absentees based on the standard threshold of 38 or more sessions of
  absence.
</p>
<p>
  Standard termly persistent absentee thresholds were calculated by taking 15%
  of the mode (most common number of) possible sessions for all enrolments.
</p>
<p>
  This meant that, in some cases, the standard threshold may be more or less
  than 15% of an individual pupil’s sessions.
</p>
<p>
  The termly persistent absence thresholds were reviewed each term to account
  for any changes to the mode possible sessions, but the thresholds did not tend
  to change from year to year. See following Table 4: Standard cumulative
  persistent absence thresholds for missing 15% of possible sessions.
