  The following calculations are used to produce absence National Statistics:

<dl class="govuk-list">
  <dt>Percentage of sessions missed due to overall absence</dt>
  <dd>(Total overall absence sessions / Total sessions possible) X 100</dd>
  <dt>Percentage of sessions missed due to authorised absence</dt>
  <dd>(Total authorised absence sessions / Total sessions possible) X 100</dd>
  <dt>Percentage of sessions missed due to unauthorised absence</dt>
  <dd>(Total unauthorised absence sessions / Total sessions possible) X 100</dd>
  <dt>Percentage of pupils with one or more session of absence by reason</dt>
  <dd>
    (Number of enrolments with one or more session of absence for a reason /
    Number of enrolments) X 100
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Percentage of overall absence for which persistent absentees are responsible
  </dt>
  <dd>
    (Overall absence sessions for persistent absentees / Total overall absence
    sessions) X 100
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Percentage of authorised absence for which persistent absentees are
    responsibe
  </dt>
  <dd>
    (Authorised absence session for persistent absentees / Total overall absence
    sessions) X 100
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Percentage of unauthorised absence for which persistent absentees are
    responsible
  </dt>
  <dd>
    (unauthorised absence sessions for persistent absentees / Total overall
    absence sessions) X 100
  </dd>
  <dt>Distribution of reasons for absence</dt>
  <dd>(Absence for this reason / Total overall absence with reasons) X 100</dd>
  <dt>Absence rates by reason</dt>
  <dd>(Absence for the reason / Total session possible) X 100</dd>
