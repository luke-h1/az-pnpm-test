<h3 id="section1-1">1.1 Pupil attendance requirements for schools</h3>
<p>
  All maintained schools are required to provide 2 possible sessions per day,
  morning and afternoon, to all pupils.
</p>
<p>
  The length of each session, break and the school day is determined by the
  school’s governing body.
</p>
<p>
  Schools must meet for at least 380 sessions or 190 days during any school year
  to educate their pupils.
</p>
<p>
  If a school is prevented from meeting for 1 or more sessions because of an
  unavoidable event, it should find a practical way of holding extra sessions.
</p>
<p>
  However, if it cannot find a practical way of doing this then it’s not
  required to make up the lost sessions.
</p>
<p>
  Academy and free school funding agreements state that the duration of the
  school day and sessions are the responsibility of the academy trust.
</p>
<p>
  Schools are required to take attendance registers twice a day - once at the
  start of the first morning session and once during the second afternoon
  session.
</p>
<p>
  In their register, schools are required to record whether pupils are:<!-- -->
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>absent</li>
  <li>attending an approved educational activity</li>
  <li>present</li>
  <li>unable to attend due to exceptional circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Where a pupil of compulsory school age is absent, schools have a
  responsibility to:<!-- -->
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>ascertain the reason</li>
  <li>ensure the proper safeguarding action is taken</li>
  <li>
    indicate in their register whether the absence is authorised by the school
    or unauthorised
  </li>
  <li>
    identify the correct code to use before entering it on to the school’s
    electronic register, or management information system which is then used to
    download data to the school census. A code set of these is available in
    <a href="#annex-sections-heading-2">Annex B</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The parent of every child of compulsory school age is required to ensure their
  child receives a suitable full-time education for their ability, age, aptitude
  and any special education needs they may have either by regular attendance at
  school or otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  Failure of a parent to secure regular attendance of their school registered
  child of compulsory school age can lead to a penalty notice or prosecution.
</p>
<p>
  Local authorities (LAs) and schools have legal responsibilities regarding
  accurate recording of a pupil’s attendance.

</p>
<h3 id="section1-2">1.2 Uses and users</h3>
<p>
  The data used to publish absence statistics is collected via the school census
  which is used by a variety of companies and organisations including:<!-- -->
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>mainstream and specialist media companies</li>
  <li>housing websites such as Rightmove and Zoopla</li>
  <li>specialist publications such as the good schools guide</li>
  <li>data analysis organisations such the Fischer Family Trust</li>
  <li>
    academic research and think tank organisations such as Durham University and
    the Education Policy Institute
  </li>
  <li>
    central government organisations such as DfE, Ofsted and other government
    departments
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The published data is also used in answers to parliamentary questions and
  public enquiries - including those made under the Freedom of Information Act.
</p>
<h3 id="section1-3">1.3 Current termly publications</h3>
<p>
  DfE publishes termly pupil absence data and statistics via the following 3
  National Statistics releases each year:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>autumn term data and statistics - published in May</li>
  <li>autumn and spring terms data and statistics - published in October</li>
  <li>full year data and statistics - published in March</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Only the full year absence release gives a definitive view of pupil absence.
</p>
<p>
  Termly publications can be affected significantly by term length with findings
  from these releases for indicative purposes only and the results should be
  treated with caution.
</p>
<p>
  DfE’s annual absence releases have been badged as National Statistics since
  the 1999/00 academic year publication.
</p>
<p>
  The termly and two-term combined releases were badged as National Statistics
  slightly later.
</p>
<p>
  The combined autumn and spring term release was badged as national statistics
  from the autumn 2006 and spring 2007 publication and the single term releases
  were badged as National Statistics as of the autumn term 2009 publication.
</p>
<h4>Historical publications</h4>
<p>
  Prior to the 2012/13 academic year DfE also published spring term only absence
  data. However, this was discontinued as it was deemed no longer necessary and
  of the least importance to users.
</p>
<p>The last spring term release was published on 30 August 2012:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/pupil-absence-in-schools-in-england-spring-term-2012"
      >Pupil absence in schools in England: spring term 2012</a
    >
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For the 2005/06 academic year, due to the transition of absence collection
  between the Absence in Schools Survey and the school census, absence
  information was published for secondary schools only as a National Statistics
  release.
</p>
<p>
  Absence data for 2005/06 were not released on a termly basis as this was the
  first year of collection.
</p>
<p>
  For academic years 1999/00 to 2004/05, annual pupil absence information was
  collected via the Absence in Schools Survey and published as an annual
  National Statistics release.
</p>
<p>
  For academic years 1993/94 to 1998/99, annual pupil absence information was
  collected via the Absence in Schools Survey and published via Statistical
  bulletins. Links to all absence publications can be found in<!-- -->
  <a href="#annex-sections-heading-3">Annex C</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="section1-4">1.4 Key absence measures</h3>
<p>
  DfE monitors pupil absence levels using two key measures - overall absence
  rate and persistent absence (PA) rate.
</p>
<p>
  These key measures are calculated for pupils who are of compulsory school age
  - ie aged between 5 and 15 as at the start of the academic year (31 August).
</p>
<p>
  Absence information is reported as totals or rates across a period, usually by
  school term or academic year.
</p>
<p>
  Overall absence is the aggregated total of all authorised and unauthorised
  absences.
</p>
<p>
  Authorised absence is absence with permission from a teacher or other
  authorised school representative - including absences where a satisfactory
  explanation has been provided. For example, through illness.
</p>
<p>
  Unauthorised absence is absence without permission from the school. This
  includes all unexplained or unjustified absences and arrivals after
  registration has closed.
</p>
<p>
  For further information:<!-- -->
  <a href="#section3-1">3.1 Overall absence methodology</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Persistent absence is when a pupil enrolment’s overall absence equates to 10%
  or more of their possible sessions.
</p>
<p>
  For further information:<!-- -->
  <a href="#section3-2">3.2 Persistent absence methodology</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="section1-5">1.5 Cohort used in absence measures</h3>
<p>
  Absence information is collected and disseminated at enrolment level rather
  than pupil level.
</p>
<p>
  This means where a pupil has moved school throughout the year, theyll be
  counted more than once as they have recorded attendance and absence at more
  than one school.
</p>
<p>
  This allows for schools to be held accountable for pupil absences, as the
  absence is attached to enrolments at a particular school, not the individual
  pupil.
</p>
<p>
  All the enrolments at a school over the period in question are included in the
  absence measures, not just the pupils on roll at a particular date.
</p>
<p>
  Schools only record absence for the period a pupil is on roll at their school.
</p>
<p>
  The number of pupil enrolments is approximately 4% higher than the number of
  pupils.
</p>
<h3 id="section1-6">1.6 The school year (five half terms vs six half terms)</h3>
<p>
  Generally, the academic year is made up of three terms - autumn, spring and
  summer.
</p>
<p>
  Each term has two parts (half-terms) which are usually separated by a half
  term break.
</p>
<p>
  Since the 2012/13 academic year, pupil absence information has been collected
  for the full academic year (ie all six half terms).
</p>
<p>
  However, prior to this absence information was collected for the first five
  half terms only, meaning absences in the second half of the summer term were
  not collected.
</p>
<p>
  Since the 2012/13 academic year, DfE's key absence indicators have been based
  on the full academic year’s (ie six half terms) data.
</p>
<p>
  However, as we're unable to rework time series tables or provide any
  historical six half term absence levels DfE continued to publish a full set of
  absence information for the first five half terms up to and including the
  2013/14 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  Following this, a single csv file based on data for five half terms has been
  published alongside the annual absence publications so longer term-time
  comparisons can still be made.
</p>
<p>
  To account for high levels of study leave and other authorised absences for
  pupils aged 15 in the second half of the summer term, all possible sessions
  and absences relating to this period for 15 year olds (as at the start of the
  academic year) are removed prior to any analysis being undertaken and are not
  included in any published statistics.

  In published absence statistics, pupil enrolments who first enrolled at a

</p>
<h3 id="section1-7">
  1.7 Published geographical and characteristics breakdowns
</h3>
<p>
  DfE routinely publishes pupil absence information at national, local authority
  and school level - including breakdowns by pupil characteristics.
</p>
<p>
  The autumn term absence publication provides high level information designed
  to give an early indication on absence levels and the effect of winter
  illness. This includes:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>authorised, unauthorised and overall absence rates</li>
  <li>absence broken down by reason</li>
  <li>
    the number of pupils with one or more sessions of absence for different
    reasons
  </li>
  <li>information on persistent absence</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The combined autumn and spring term publication includes similar information
  to that of the autumn term. However, it also includes absence levels broken
  down by pupil:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>ethnic group</li>
  <li>first language</li>
  <li>free school meal eligibility</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>national curriculum year group</li>
  <li>special educational need</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The full academic year's absence publication includes combined absence #
  information for the autumn, spring and summer terms.
</p>
<p>
  It’s the largest publication and includes similar breakdowns to that of the
  combined autumn and spring term publication (as outlined above) as well as
  persistent absence broken down by reason for absence and pupil characteristic.
</p>
<p>Additional breakdowns included in this full year release relate to the:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>distribution of enrolments by length of overall absence</li>
  <li>percentage of enrolments by their overall absence</li>
  <li>number of schools by the percentage of persistent absentees</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In this publication, information is also provided at district level, based on
  Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) and by degree of rurality.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, from 2015/16 onwards, characteristics include free school meal
  eligibility in the last six years.
</p>
<p>
  The Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) is provided by the
  Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG).
</p>
<p>
  The index measures the proportion of all children aged 0 to 15 living in
  income deprived families and is based on Lower-layer Super Output Areas
  (LSOAs) in England.
</p>
<p>
  Each LSOA is given a rank between 1 and 32,844 where the LSOA with the rank of
  1 is the most deprived LSOA and the LSOA with the rank of 32,844 is the most
  deprived.
</p>
<p>
  IDACI is a subset of the Income Deprivation Domain of the Index of Multiple
  Deprivation 2015 which measures the proportion of the population in an area
  experiencing deprivation relating to low income.
</p>
<p>
  The definition of low income used includes both those people that are
  out-of-work and those that are in work but who have low earnings (and who
  satisfy the respective means tests).
</p>
<p>
  For further information about IDACI:<!-- -->

    href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015"
    >English indices of deprivation 2015</a
  >.
</p>
<p>IDACI bands from 2014/15 are based on 2015 IDACI scores.</p>
<p>
  IDACI bands for 2010/11 to 2013/14 are based on 2010 IDACI scores and those
  for 2007/08 to 2009/10 are based on 2007 IDACI scores.
</p>
<p>
  Care should be taken when comparing IDACI tables based on different IDACI
  scores.
</p>
<p>
  The Rural and Urban Area Classification is a product of a joint project to
  produce a single and consistent classification of urban and rural areas. The
  project was sponsored by a number of government departments.
</p>
<p>
  The rural and urban definitions classify output areas, wards and super output
  areas by aggregating the underlying hectare grid squares classifications for
  the measures of settlement size and sparsity.
</p>
<p>
  Up to eight classes of output areas could be distinguished - four settlement
  types (urban, town and fringe, village, hamlet and isolated dwelling) in
  either a sparse or less sparse regional setting.
</p>
<p>
  Absence data by degree of rurality from 2014/15 has been analysed based on the
  2011 Rural and Urban Area Classification, whereas equivalent data for previous
  years was analysed based on the 2004 Rural and Urban Area Classification.
</p>
<p>
  For further information about Rural and Urban Area Classification 2011:<!-- -->

</p>
<p>
  A full list of published absence breakdowns (as of the latest academic year's
  releases) is available in<!-- -->
  <a href="#annex-sections-heading-4">Annex D</a>.
</p>
<p>
  From 2015/16 onwards, published tables on characteristics breakdowns include
  figures for pupils with unclassified or missing characteristics information.
</p>
<p>
  This represents a small proportion of all pupils and the figures should be
  interpreted with caution.
</p>
<p>
  For some characteristics, like free school meals eligibility, pupils with
  unclassified or missing characteristics information have been found to have a
  low average number of sessions possible, which might explain more variability
  in absence rates which use the number of possible sessions as a denominator.
</p>
<h3 id="section1-8">1.8 Underlying data provided alongside publications</h3>
<p>
  From the 2009/10 academic year, each National Statistics release has been
  accompanied by underlying data, including national, local authority and school
  level information.
</p>
<p>
  Alongside the underlying data there's an accompanying document (metadata)
  which provides further information on the contents of these files.
