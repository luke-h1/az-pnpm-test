<h3 id="section6-1">Data quality</h3>
<p>
  The following should be taken into account when reviewing published pupil
  absence statistics.
</p>
<p>
  The absence information reported in published releases is based on data
  returned by schools as part of the school census
</p>
<p>This might include duplicates if schools have recorded duplicated pupils.</p>
<p>
  It does not include data which has been submitted by local authorities (LAs)
  or schools outside of the school census.<!-- -->
</p>
<p>
  It's a school's responsibility to record absence data correctly in their
  school census return and the parent's responsibility to truthfully report the
  reason for a child's absence from school.
</p>
<p>
  Only full-year absence statistics give a definitive view of pupil absence so
  figures presented in the interim termly publications should be treated with
  caution.
</p>
<p>
  Caution is recommended when interpreting the data for Traveller of Irish
  Heritage and Gypsy/Roma children due to potential under-reporting for these
  ethnic classifications.
