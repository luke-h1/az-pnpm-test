<p>
  How pupil absence data goes from raw school census returns to a finalised
  dataset used to prepare National Statistics releases.
</p>
<h3 id="section5-1">5.1 Data linking</h3>
<p>
  Annual and combined termly absence data are derived by linking pupil records
  collected in each relevant school census to calculate overall totals for the
  number of:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list-bullet">
  <li>possible sessions</li>
  <li>sessions missed by reason for absence</li>
  <li>
    sessions missed due to authorised and unauthorised absence for each
    enrolment
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Derived absence totals are then linked to a pupil's characteristics data (also
  collected via the school census) at the time of the absence.
</p>
<p>
  Where characteristics data are missing, information collected in the following
  census are used, except for ethnicity as this information is only collected in
  the spring school census. See following Table 11: Characteristics linking for
  absence data.
</p>
<p>
  For pupil enrolments joining mid-academic year, characteristic information is
  taken from the census relating to the term of absence. If no data is available
  the following census is used.
</p>
<p>
  Characteristics data is only linked once, on the earliest term of data, so
  'in-year' changes in characteristic information will not be picked up until
  the following academic year.

<h3 id="section5-2">5.2 Data removed</h3>
<p>
  To prepare the absence data for publication routine checks are applied to the
  linked data and where necessary data is removed as follows.
</p>
<p>
  Schools with fewer than 6 pupil enrolments aged between five and fifteen years
  are removed from the analysis.
</p>
<p>
  This usually amounts to a negligible number of schools - most commonly post-16
  establishments with a small number of 15 year old pupils.
</p>
<p>
  For all pupil enrolments, if the number of possible sessions in a term is
  zero, missing or less than the total number of sessions missed due to overall
  absence, then the enrolment is removed from the absence data and not included
  in National Statistics.
</p>
<p>
  Any sponsored academies which opened part-way through a term and provided
  predecessor school absence data via the school census will have the term of
  data which includes predecessor information removed before any analysis.
</p>
<p>
  This absence data is removed because when a sponsored academy opens it is a
  new school and therefore should not be held accountable for absence levels
  accrued within the predecessor school.
</p>
<p>
  To identify these academies we look at their average number of possible
  sessions (mean and mode) supplied via the school census.
</p>
<p>
  If a sponsored academy has a higher average possible sessions than we would
  expect, estimated using their open date, we assume they've supplied
  information for their predecessor school.<!-- -->
</p>
<p>
  Table 12 provides examples of sponsored academies which would be reviewed when
  compiling autumn and spring terms absence data.
</p>
<p>
  We'd expect schools to provide around 250 possible sessions across the autumn
  and spring term.

  Year-on-year comparisons of local authority data may be affected by schools
  converting to academies.

<h3 id="section5-3">5.3 Variables added</h3>
<p>
  Most of the variables needed to produce national level absence statistics can
  be calculated directly from the fields collected via the school census.
</p>
<p>
  However, to prepare the absence data for publication the following variables
  are also added to the dataset.
</p>
<h4 id="section5-3-1">
  5.3.1 Authorised, unauthorised and overall absence totals
</h4>
<p>
  Termly authorised and unauthorised absence totals are derived by taking
  whichever is highest â€“ either the total authorised or unauthorised absence
  sessions provided by the school or the sum of the authorised or unauthorised
  absence reasons provided by the school.
</p>
<p>
  These fields are set to zero if the absence totals greater than the number of
  sessions possible or if the number of sessions possible is equal to zero.
</p>
<p>
  The termly overall absence total is calculated by taking the sum of the
  authorised and unauthorised absence totals.
</p>
<p>
  Again this is set to zero if the absence total is greater than the number of
  sessions possible or if the number of sessions possible is equal to zero.
</p>
<p>
  Full-year totals are derived by summing the termly totals together.<!-- -->
</p>
<h4 id="section5-3-2">5.3.2 Persistent absentee indicators</h4>
<p>
  An indicator variable for the published persistent absence measure is added to
  each enrolment before producing any analysis.
</p>
<p>
  This is derived by comparing each enrolment's overall absence total to their
  own possible sessions to establish if they have missed 10% or more of the
  sessions available to them
</p>
<p>
  For further information:<!-- -->
  <a href="#section3-2"> 3.2 Persistent absence methodology</a>.
</p>
<h4 id="section5-3-3">5.3.3 School and academy type</h4>
<p>
  School type information - including school type, academy type and academy open
  date - are added to our underlying data prior to producing any analysis to
  allow us to produce the school- and academy-type breakdowns in our statistical
  releases.
</p>
<p>
  These variables are derived using a combination of Edubase and the<!-- -->

    >Open academies and academy projects</a
  >
  <!-- -->in development data.
</p>
<p>
  Within absence National Statistics, academies are only indicated as academies
  if they were open as of 12 September.
</p>
<h3 id="section5-4">5.4 Consistency checks</h3>
<p>
  After the data is processed as previously set out, consistency checks are
  performed against our<!-- -->
  <a
    href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-school-and-pupil-numbers"
    >Schools, pupils and their characteristics</a
  >
  <!-- -->National Statistics releases to check the numbers of schools and
  enrolments are as expected.
</p>
<p>
  Further checks are carried out on the consistency of figures compared with
  previous years, both nationally and at local authority level.
